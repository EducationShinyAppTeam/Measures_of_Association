Probability,var1,Q1,1) 22%,"The Australian Melanoma Study looked at 601 cases of people with melanoma skin cancer and 479 control subjects who did not have skin cancer and questioned them about their prior use of tanning beds. Amongst the people with melanoma, about 22% had used a tanning bed and about 3.5 times as many had never used a tanning bed. But amongst the control subjects 17.5% of the subjects had used a tanning bed and about 4.7 times as many had never used one. The researchers noted that 4.7/3.5 = 1.34(around) and used that number to describe the relationship between melanoma skin cancer and tanning bed use."
